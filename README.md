# JAOPS Grafana Yamcs Plugin

A Grafana plugin to directly connect to the Yamcs server, display telemetry and send commands.
This plugin is engineered for high reliability to be used in Mission Control Centers and anywhere Yamcs is used. 

The current version has already been tested in real-world deployments but active development continues and community feedback and contributions are very welcome.


## Features

- **Multiplexed Endpoint Support** – Designed to handle complex setups with multiple Yamcs endpoints through a robust multiplexer system. Supports scaling to many Grafana clients efficiently by multiplexing the connections to Yamcs: the same data is only requested once. 

- **Modular and Scalable Architecture** – Clean separation of concerns and a solid backend structure built for reliability and flexibility.

- **Telemetry & Static Image Panel** – Visualize real-time telemetry data or overlay data on static images (e.g. spacecraft layouts, maps).

- **Commanding Panel** – Issue commands via a Grafana panel with fully customizable buttons, supporting arguments, comments, and endpoint targeting.

- **Intuitive UI/UX** – Clean and simple user interface designed to be easy to use, even for non-experts.

- **Live Status Feedback** – Displays endpoint availability and WebSocket status in real-time, ensuring quick diagnostics.

- **Fully Configurable** – Every aspect of the plugin—from endpoint configuration to command structure and visual layout is configurable through Grafana's settings.
