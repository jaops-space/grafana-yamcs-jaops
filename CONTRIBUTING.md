**Categories** can include (but are not limited to):
- `Chore` ‚Äì Routine tasks or refactoring

Use lowercase and hyphens for readability.

### Examples:

- `fix/commanding-timeout`
- `refactor/multiplexer-cleanup`

## Pull Requests

- All PRs **must pass CI checks** before being reviewed.
- Keep PRs focused and atomic (one logical change per PR).
- Include relevant details in the PR description (what it does, why it matters).
- If you're fixing a bug or implementing a feature, reference the related issue if applicable.

## Code Style & Testing

- Match the existing code style.
- Write tests if you're adding new functionality or fixing bugs.
- Run tests locally before pushing if possible.

## Issues

- Use **Pascal Case** for issue titles as well:
  - Example: `Feature: Add Support For X`
  - Example: `Bug: Crash When Doing Y`

- Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
